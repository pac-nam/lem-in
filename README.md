Ce programme permet a un grand nombre d'entités de se déplacer entre deux points en optimisant leurs déplacement et leurs itinéraires afin de ne pas encombrer les itinéraires les plus simples, mais aussi les plus utilisés.

We are going to look in depth at its calculus bit. How does it work? Simple! We
make an ant farm, with tunnels and rooms; we place the ants on one side; and we look
at how they find the exit.
How do we build an ant farm? We need tubes and rooms
We join the rooms to one another with as many tubes as we need. A tube joins two
rooms to each other. No more than that. A room can be linked to an infinite number
of rooms and by as many tubes as deemed necessary. Then we must bury the ant farm
(wherever you want). This is extremely important to ensure that ants don’t cheat and
look at your design before before the game starts.
Because arts and crafts with boxes, tape and ropes are not our greatest strength, we will
create a digital version instead.
